The screenshots and learning content from [Sean Allen's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSIe2y6Fee8) looked very promising. Unfortunately the course is a bit too expensive for me personally, so I will try to implement the screens myself and stick to his list. It will be my `Take Home Exercise` and a `work in progress` depending on my spare time.

## General
I won't set myself any time limitation like I said it will be a `work in progress / side project` beside work & studies, it is just for learning puropse.
